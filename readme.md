##### ESX is the leading framework for creating roleplay servers on FiveM, with many official and community resources designed to utilise the tools provided here. For a taste of what's available

> esx_identity: Enables character registration defining a players name, sex, height, and date of birth
> esx_society: Allows job resources to register a society, gaining employee management, society funds, and more
> esx_billing: Allows members of some societies to send fines or bills to other players
> esx_vehicleshop: Allow players to purchase vehicles from a dealership, or setup society support for a player-managed dealership
> esx_ambulancejob: Adds a death and respawn system while allowing players to work as EMS to heal and revive others

Many more resources are included in this repository, or you can browse the [ESX Community Github](https://github.com/esx-community/) or [Cfx.re Releases board](https://forum.cfx.re/tag/esx) for more.
